The dataset includes 1720 images.
Forklift-flac are annotated in YOLO v7 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.33 percent of pixels
